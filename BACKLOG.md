## F-077.x — Convert JSON-as-Text columns to JSONB

**Filed:** F-077 (PostgreSQL local-dev parity), 2026-04-27.
**Status:** post-launch.

The codebase stores JSON-shaped data in `Column(Text)` with `json.dumps()` / `json.loads()` in application code. Approx 8–12 such columns across `Feedback`, `Recording`, `Conversation`, `RemediationModule`, `EcoleQuizQuestion`, `Tache2Scenario`, possibly others. Convert to PostgreSQL `JSONB` for native indexing, querying, and storage efficiency.

**Scope:**
- Rewrite affected `Column(Text)` declarations to `Column(JSONB)` (or SQLAlchemy's portable `JSON` if cross-engine matters — JSONB if not).
- Drop `json.dumps()` on every write site; drop `json.loads()` on every read site. SQLAlchemy handles serialization for native JSON columns.
- One Alembic migration per logical group, with `USING column::jsonb` casts for in-place conversion (production data is already valid JSON text by construction; the cast should not lose data, but the migration must include a smoke-test step that round-trips a sample row).
- Add JSONB GIN indexes on commonly-queried paths if any (e.g. `data_targets ? 'foo'`, `criteria_breakdown @> '[{"criterion_key":"X"}]'`).

**Estimate:** 1–2 days. Mostly mechanical edits across read/write call sites; the discipline cost is making sure no caller still wraps the value in `json.dumps()`.

**Out of scope:** schema redesign of the JSON shapes themselves (those stay).
